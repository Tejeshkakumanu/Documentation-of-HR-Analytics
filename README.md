 ## KPI- 1
- Average Attrition Rate For All Departments :
----------------
This KPI highlights the connection between departments and attrition rates. The Research & Development Department faces higher attrition, suggesting potential issues. Meanwhile, the Hardware Department's lower rate indicates successful retention practices. By understanding these patterns, the organization can tailor strategies to address specific departmental needs, fostering overall employee satisfaction and retention.
